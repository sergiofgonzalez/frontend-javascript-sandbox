# 03 &mdash; Changing the DOM!
> performing modifications in the DOM

## Description

The following methods can be used to do modifications in the DOM:
+ `removeChild` &mdash; removes the given child node from the document.
+ `appendChild` &mdash; puts a node at the end of the list of children of the given node.
+ `insertBefore` &mdash; inserts the node given as the first argument before the node given as the second argument.
+ `replaceChild` &mdash; replaces a child node with another one.

Node that a node can exist in the document in only one place, and therefore, as a side effect, when you put it in another place it will be removed from its previous position.
