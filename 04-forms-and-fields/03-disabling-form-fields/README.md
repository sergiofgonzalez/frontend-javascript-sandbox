# 03 &mdash; Disabling Form Fields
> exploring the `disabled` attribute

## Description

All form fields can be disabled using the `disabled` attribute, which also exists as a property on the element's DOM object.

In the example, when the button is clicked, the button is disabled for 5 seconds so that it cannot submit further requests.
